# Capstone-Project

Here is a fully functional android app which I made from scratch for [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud876-1/l-4333029280/m-4376351203). This app also reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

##Jetpack Reader

Jetpack Reader is an Android app to read content from [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) Wordpress plugin. This project was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as "Exceeds Specifications".

##Features
- Retrieve all categories
- Discover contents from all categories
- Sync content automatically via SyncAdapter
- App widget
- Offline database

##How to Work with the Source

This app uses [Wordpress API](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) to retrieve content. You must provide your own site URL to get the content. When you know it, just paste it to:  `Constant.java`
